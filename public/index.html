      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes of Joey.
    </h3>
    <p>Friends fans know the show would be nothing without the relationships between Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Monica,
      Phoebe, and Joey. But while some argue that Rachel is the best character on the show, others prefer Phoebe’s out
      there personality. That said, there’s one character almost any fan of the show can agree on: Joey. He might not be
      anyone’s lobster, he might not make up hilarious coffee shop songs, and he might not have a secure job, but he is
      one of the most loyal characters on the show. </p>
